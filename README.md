# Data-Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in your computer so that it can be used effectively.
In this repository i'm going to solve problems on data structures.
I'll provide the solutions of each and every program performed in data structure during my 2nd Semester.
Data Structure is nothing but a set of collection of processed data so called Information.
In this repository we will understand some important programs on Array and Linked List.
Traversing , Searching , Sorting , Deletion , Insertion and Merge.
